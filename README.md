# My Hobby Page

Welcome to My Hobby Page! This React application allows you to display a customizable banner with a background color, text, and image URL. You can update the banner settings dynamically using a form to change the background color, banner text, and image URL.

The app also fetches a default profile picture from GitHub, which can be used as the image for the banner.

## Features

- Customize the banner's background color using a color picker.
- Modify the banner text to display a personalized message.
- Set the banner's image via a URL input field or fetch a default GitHub profile picture.
- Responsive and interactive user interface with React hooks for dynamic updates.

## Technologies Used
